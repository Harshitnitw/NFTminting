I tried to contact Dyeus team on Skype and by mail that the code present in the assignment they have shared is not compiling. They asked me to share the previous work I have done in Web3. So I shared the details about the project I did on Solidity with them along with the github link to the project.

Since the error in the code was not resolved even after trying the steps mentioned in the assignment, I couldn't complete the assignment because the issues are left unresolved. As the group members asked me to describe the projects I have done in past on Web3, I am writing about my project details over here:


My project is a blockchain-based NFT platform that allows users to mint and trade unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that resemble Pokeballs. Unlike traditional Pokeballs, which have a set design, my Pokeball NFTs are completely random and unique, consisting of a collection of random layers of different permutations and combinations.

Here's how my project works:

Minting Pokeball NFTs: I can use my platform to create my own random Pokeball NFTs. To do this, I first choose the number of layers I want my Pokeball to have. The more layers I choose, the more complex and unique my Pokeball will be. Once I've selected the number of layers, my platform generates a random collection of layers, consisting of different permutations and combinations of colors, patterns, textures, and other design elements. This creates a completely unique and random Pokeball NFT that has never been seen before.

Trading Pokeball NFTs: Once I have minted my Pokeball NFTs, I can trade them on my platform. My platform uses a blockchain to record the ownership and transfer of each NFT, ensuring that each NFT is unique and verifiable. I can list my NFTs for sale, or I can trade them directly with other users.

Transparency and verification: Since my platform is built on a blockchain, all transactions and ownership records are recorded and verified on the blockchain. This ensures that each NFT is unique and cannot be duplicated or replicated, providing a transparent and secure trading platform for me as a user.

My project is available on Github at the link https://github.com/Harshitnitw/NFTminting, which means that other developers can contribute to the project or build their own applications using my code. Overall, my project provides a unique and random twist on traditional Pokeballs, giving me as a collector and trader a new way to own and trade unique Pokeball NFTs.
